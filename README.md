# 🙋‍♂️ About me ...

As a researcher specializing in industrial artificial intelligence, robotics, and simulation, I develop AI-driven solutions to tackle complex engineering challenges and enhance the efficiency of industrial processes. My Ph.D. research at Brno University of Technology focused on advancing industrial robotics methods in alignment with the principles of Industry 4.0. This research laid the foundation for my ongoing work in developing AI-driven methods to enhance efficiency and flexibility in autonomous systems for industrial applications.

With extensive experience leading research projects, mentoring researchers and engineers, and fostering international collaboration, I am committed to pushing the boundaries of technological innovation through cutting-edge AI methods in industrial applications.

Passionate about knowledge sharing, I actively contribute to the robotics community through open-source projects, with my work available on GitHub and YouTube, and my research published on Google Scholar. I also regularly present research findings at international and regional conferences.

Some of my quotes. Please, think about it... 💡

1. If you want to improve something, you must first understand it. The combination of theoretical and practical knowledge is not an option, it is a must.
2. Active participation within the open-source community, not only as a user but also as a contributor, is essential to ensuring continued growth.

Beyond my professional work, I am dedicated to continuous learning, sustainability, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle through running and mindful nutrition.
